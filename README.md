## DESCRIPTION

- Manage your Magisk modules from recovery (e.g., TWRP) -- run "sh /sdcard/mm" on recovery terminal.

Features list

- List installed modules
- Toggle
  - Core only mode
  - Magic mount
  - Disable
  - Remove



## PREREQUISITE

- Magisk 17-19



## SETUP

Install
- Flash live (e.g., from Magisk Manager) or from custom recovery (e.g., TWRP).

Uninstall
- Use Magisk Manager app or mm itself (supports `uninstall.sh`, too).



## USAGE

- First time (right after installing/updating) - run `mm` or `sh /sdcard/mm` on recovery terminal.
- Next times (while in recovery) - no need to re-flash the zip; simply run `sh /sdcard/mm` on recovery terminal.
- Follow the instructions/wizard. Everything is interactive.
- Pro tip: lazy people can try running `*/mm` instead of `sh /sdcard/mm`.
